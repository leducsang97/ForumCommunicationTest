This is my submission for Forum Communications Company's interview quiz.

The repo includes 3 files to answer these questions:

Design Implementation

Break the article design in the attached png file (HTML_CSS Quiz) into a functional web page using css grid for both mobile and desktop layouts. Since this is a flat file and not a layered Photoshop/Sketch, document font choices, colors, etc can be chosen to match as closely as possible. Use any text you'd like, as long as it fills in about the same amount of text as the design.

Recommended Time Allowance: 2 hours or less

Custom Javascript Widget

Create a custom widget using JQuery starting with this structured JSON file: https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews.json
The finished widget should display some basic information about the first 5 items in the feed such as title, url, and domain.
The widget should fit within a standard ad size of 300px wide by 600px tall.
Design is up to you. Creativity is encouraged.

Recommended Time Allowance: 2 hours or less

ZeroCool

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
But for multiples of three print "Zero" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Cool".
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "ZeroCool".
This should be written in Javascript and be able to run in the console.

Recommended Time Allowance: 30 minutes
