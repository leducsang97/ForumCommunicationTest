// Design Implementation

// Break the article design in the attached png file (HTML_CSS Quiz) into a functional web page using css grid for both mobile and desktop layouts.  Since this is a flat file and not a layered Photoshop/Sketch, document font choices, colors, etc can be chosen to match as closely as possible. Use any text you'd like, as long as it fills in about the same amount of text as the design.

// Recommended Time Allowance:  2 hours or less
